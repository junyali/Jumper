## About

This is Jumper. There is no end, but your death. Don't stop jumping.

**Controls**
Move Left / Right: A / D or Left / Right arrow keys respectively
Jump: Spacebar or Up arrow key

**Score calculation**
The score is calculated by the sum of every second you survived times the multiplier at that second. The game penalises you for staying higher by decreasing the multiplier, so try and stay lower without dying!

*For the extraordinarily difficult platforms, you can walk off the edge further than you think, wink (coyote time)!*
